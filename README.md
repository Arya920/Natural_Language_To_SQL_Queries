### Speak2SQl 
This web app is built to convert the natural language to sql queries. It is powered by 2 state of the art Transformer model, 
- GEMMA 2B
- Deepseek Coder 1.3B

Both the models are fine tuned over 3000 rows and have been tested againest 100 seperate rows. The evaluation metrics used for evaluating these models are ~ 
- BLEU SCORE
- SCAR BLEU SCORE
- EM RATIO

Here BLEU SCORE considers the ngram probability and checks that if the predicted text matches with the actual text over n-gram, whereas EM Ratio checks that the predicted query exactly matches with the actual query or not.
